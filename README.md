# Chilean-College-Admissions-Data-Analysis
This project analyzes the 2007 Chilean college admissions process for students graduating from Osorno (10th region). The admissions system is run annually by the Chilean College Board, where students take national exams (Math, Verbal, Science, History) and are evaluated alongside their NEM score (high school performance).
